# TicTacToe

## Before starting
Looking at the code provided- theres a few good arguments for just starting from scratch
* No tests - and no way to write any non-brittle tests
* Bad patterns - trying to continue expanding the code will just result in the propogation of these patterns
* non communicative - It's possible to work out whats going on, but is it worth the time if it's all going to be massively change
